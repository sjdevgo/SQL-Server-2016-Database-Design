# SQL-Server-2016-Database-Design

Overview:

## Goal: To design a secure database solution with high availability and implement backup and recovery strategies.
Key Components:

1. High Availability:

* Understand concepts such as clustering, mirroring, and replication that help ensure that the database remains accessible and operational, even during failures.
* Discuss any specific methods or technologies you implemented to achieve high availability.
2. Backup and Recovery Strategies:

* Backup Types: Full, differential, and transaction log backups.
* Recovery Models: Understand the differences between simple, full, and bulk-logged recovery models and how they affect data recovery.
* Be prepared to explain the strategies you developed to minimize downtime and ensure data integrity.
3. Automated Maintenance Plans:

* Definition: Scheduled tasks that help maintain the health and performance of the database, such as index maintenance and statistics updates.
* Discuss the benefits of automating these tasks and any specific maintenance plans you created.
4. Disaster Recovery Planning:

* Understand the importance of having a disaster recovery plan that outlines procedures for data restoration in the event of a major failure.
* Consider discussing how you assessed risks and determined the necessary steps for disaster recovery.
